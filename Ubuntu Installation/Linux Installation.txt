Installing Linux on your PC is quite straightforward! Here’s a **step-by-step beginner-friendly guide** 👇

---

### 🧩 **1. Choose a Linux Distribution**

Pick a version (called a *distro*) based on your needs:

* **Ubuntu** → Easiest for beginners, great community support
* **Linux Mint** → Very user-friendly, looks like Windows
* **Pop!_OS** → Great for developers and gaming
* **Fedora** → Cutting-edge and stable
* **Debian** → Stable, used for servers

👉 For your first time, I recommend **Ubuntu** or **Linux Mint**.

### 💾 **2. Download the ISO File**

Go to the official website and download the ISO file:

* [Ubuntu Download](https://ubuntu.com/download)
* [Linux Mint Download](https://linuxmint.com/download.php)

The `.iso` file is a disk image of the operating system.

### 🔥 **3. Create a Bootable USB Drive**

You’ll need:

* A **USB drive (at least 8GB)**
* A tool like:

  * **Rufus** (Windows) → [https://rufus.ie](https://rufus.ie)
  * **BalenaEtcher** (Windows/macOS/Linux) → [https://etcher.io](https://etcher.io)

**Steps using Rufus:**

1. Plug in your USB drive.
2. Open Rufus.
3. Under *Boot selection*, choose the Linux ISO file.
4. Click **Start** → it will erase the USB and make it bootable.

### ⚙️ **4. Boot from the USB**

1. Restart your computer.
2. Enter the **boot menu**:

   * Usually by pressing **F12**, **Esc**, **F2**, or **Del** right after turning it on.
3. Select your USB drive to boot from it.

### 💡 **5. Try or Install Linux**

You’ll see an option:

* **Try Linux** → Run it without installing (safe to test)
* **Install Linux** → Permanently install it on your PC

If you choose to install:

1. Follow the on-screen steps.
2. Choose:

   * “Install alongside Windows” → for dual boot
   * “Erase disk and install Linux” → removes everything
3. Set your **username, password**, and **timezone**.
4. Wait for installation to finish, then remove the USB and reboot.

### 🚀 **6. After Installation**

* Linux will start up!
* Update your system:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
  ```
* Explore the **Software Center** to install apps (like Chrome, VS Code, etc.).
